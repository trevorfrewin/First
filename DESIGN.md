# Tesla Motors Data Analysis
## Overview
The Tesla Motors Data Analysis (TMDA) is designed to provide analysis of your Tesla Motors vehicle (Model2, X or 3) performance and statistics over time.
## Why make the TMDA?
A number of excellent Tesla-focussed products exist in the market today - from providing near-real-time recording of the car's context to direct access to the car's functions and a lot in between.  
TMDA provides analysis of Tesla-related data across time.
Examples of Tesla-related data that could use good time-aware analysis could include:  
+ incident recording
    - MCU resets
    - hard resets
+ event recording
    - software updates
    - tire pressure events
    - other things
    - warnings
+ other things  

This is important in diagnosing problems, keeping "full service history" records, understanding events that might recur more often in different seasons, and more.  
Additional benefits to owners might be to track mileage over time.

When specifically authorised to do so, the TMDA could return data to Tesla to help them understand their customers' needs and the behaviours of Tesla products *over time*.

# How the TMDO works
Essentially, a two-part process.  
Part one is the collection of events. This is raw data, and when it is collected it is specifically stored with a time-series focus.  
Part two is the analysis of the data.
